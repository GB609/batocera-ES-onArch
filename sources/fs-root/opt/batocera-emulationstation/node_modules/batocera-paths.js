/**
 * @file
 * @brief JS-pendant to `/etc/batocera-paths.conf`, maintained separately for performance reasons.
 * This file reads or defines the package-specific file path configuration properties for the current runtime.  
 * In theory, it is duplicated code because it does the same thing that `batocera-paths.conf` does. 
 * However, because node can't parse shell without workarounds and bash can't directly execute js, there is no direct
 * way to use the very same file in both contexts, without having one context spawn a sub-process just to map (and parse)
 * the configuration. This would incur a needless performance hit, because the configuration has to be read everytime.  
 *  
 * **Note:**
 * This module does not export anything. For the sake of convenience, the path configuration is placed in `globalThis.PATHS` instead.  
 * So, it is sufficient to use `require('batocera-paths')`.
