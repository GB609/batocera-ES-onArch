# - **none**: unset `SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG`
# - **external**: Uses the return value of [_controls:sdl-useExternal] 
# - **passthrough**: default. Take what effectiveProperties has calcaluted from es_input.cfg for the connected controllers.

# @section Configuration of antimicrox
# This part of the logic contains a set of functions and switch-case blocks that handle controller replacment by AntiMicroX.  
# Actually using AMX requires several steps when starting a game:
# 1. Make sure SDL config is correct
# 2. locate the profile to use. User-based profiles might have to be created first
# 3. Restart AMX with another profile
# 4. Make sure the game does not get controller events
# 5. Restart AMX in "GUIDE" mode after the game ends  
#
# Not all steps of this procedure all encapsulated in functions. Some are just a list of statements following
# the function declarations. As such, they are not documented in more detail here.
#
# Aside from use in-game, AMX will also have to run all the time even when batocera itself is up.  
# **Reason:** The `guide`-button will be handled by AMX. This is easier to manage than having to re-configure X or Wayland etc.
# @see [AntiMicroX](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox)

# @description
# When the setting `controller_profile` has any game-, emulator- or system-specific value,
# the corresponding profile is normally user-specific and thus part of user saves.  
# This function assists in creating new profiles, to make sure they are in line with a certain set of required keybinds.  
# **Reason:** To ensure that the `guide` button works uniformly across all apps and games (for os-wide intervention),
# it has to be defined in ALL profiles in the same way.  
# Thus, new profiles should be based on a template, OR be patched afterwards to correct misconfigurations done by the user.
# @arg (string) realm of user defined, one of `u-game`, `u-system`, `u-emu`

# @description
# This function will be called when the property `controller_profile` is set to any value other than `none`.  
# It will evaluate the property value and try to locate the actual profile file. However, the profile will 
# not be used as is, because we must ensure that the guide button works uniformly across all profiles.  
# Therefore, a temporary profile will be created, by selectively merging the located target with the `GUIDE` profile:
# 1. Overwrite the `GUIDE` button in all profile sets with the one from GUIDE
# 2. Overwrite (or add) the last set (index 8) from the GUIDE profile to the base profile. This set contains 
#    the control definitions needed to navigate the OS menu.
# 
# The merging is not done in bash. It is done by `btc-config applyGuideProfile`.
