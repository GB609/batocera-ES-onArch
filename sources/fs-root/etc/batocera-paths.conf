# @brief System/package paths
# @description
# To support tests, multiple package locations or custom repackaging, most of the file system paths describing the 
# package installation can be reconfigured dynamically. This file containes several variable definitions specifying
# certain aspects of the packages' system installation.  
# This paths are:
# - `FS_ROOT`: Where the 'root' of the file system is. Usually '/'. Most paths are defined to resolve against this.
# - `CONFIG_ROOT`: Directory where all config files of the package are placed. Contains the files generated by btc-config
# - `DROPIN_DIR`: Normally a sub-dir of `CONFIG_ROOT` - this is where users and devs should place additional files
# - `BTC_PKG_DIR`: Where `btc-config` and the `support` directory is placed
# - `EL_PKG_DIR`: Files related to emulatorlauncher ONLY
# - `SH_LIB_DIR`: Generic shell helper files, used by both emulatorlauncher AND other support scripts
#  
# The trickiest part in all scripts using this is that they first need to find the correct path to this file, relative
# to the package location. This usually means that `FS_ROOT` has to be recalculated or hardcoded in at least one initial
# startup file.

_scriptPath="$(readlink -f "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")"
# when no FS_ROOT is given from outside, assume default package location and structure:
# this conf file will be placed under /etc directly.
FS_ROOT=${FS_ROOT:-${_scriptPath%/etc/batocera-paths.conf}}

# System-wide configuration directory
CONFIG_ROOT=${CONFIG_ROOT:-"$FS_ROOT"/etc/batocera-emulationstation}
DROPIN_DIR=${DROPIN_DIR:-"$CONFIG_ROOT"/conf.d}
# Where btc-config and the real emulationstation bin folder is
BTC_PKG_DIR=${BTC_PKG_DIR:-"$FS_ROOT"/opt/batocera-emulationstation}
# Where emulatorlauncher pulls its adapters and private libraries from
EL_PKG_DIR=${EL_PKG_DIR:-"$FS_ROOT"/opt/emulatorlauncher}
# generic shell library files
SH_LIB_DIR=${SH_LIB_DIR:-"$BTC_PKG_DIR"/lib}
