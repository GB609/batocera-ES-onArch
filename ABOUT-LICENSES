The ArchLinux package 'batocera-emulationstation' produced by the PKGBUILD file 
of the aforementioned repository is composite work of multiple, differently licensed sources.

This is mainly caused by the main component, batocera-emulationstation  
and its unique expectation of how the environment is supposed to look like.

1. batocera-emulationstation itself uses MIT.
   This applies to all files and subfolders in the following locations (exceptions and additions are listed at the end of this file):
   - /opt/batocera-emulationstation/bin
   - /usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/emulationstation2.mo

2. batocera-emulationstation/external contains source copies of other works with varying licenses.
   These libraries are compiled and linked statically during the build of batocera-emulationstation.

3. batocera-emulationstation contains fonts licensed under ubuntu or apache

4. The PKGBUILD downloads some (source) configuration files from batocera.linux as input to generate
   a couple of configuration files for batocera-emulationstation.
   batocera-linux sources are covered by GPL-2.0-or-later, as inherited by buildroot.
   These source files are placed under /opt/batocera-emulationstation/conf.d,
   The generated files are located in /etc/batocera-emulationstation (excluding subdirs).

5. The source repository above contains additional scripts and configuration files which are used 
   to build and supply the environment & OS interface for batocera-emulationstation to make it run
   outside of batocera.linux (and in a multi-user, configurable way).
   batocera-emulationstation itself compiles without the additional files, but it would not be functional.
   See https://github.com/batocera-linux/batocera-emulationstation/blob/master/README.md for details.
   As such, these additions are an elementary part needed to get a usable, working package.
   All files which are directly contained in https://github.com/GB609/batocera-ES-onArch are licensed under MIT.

6. The PKGBUILD also downloads one config file from https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de: es_find_rules.xml.
   This file is not related to batocera-emulationstation directly. 
   Instead it is used in the implementation of 'emulatorlauncher' supplied by batocera-ES-onArch.
