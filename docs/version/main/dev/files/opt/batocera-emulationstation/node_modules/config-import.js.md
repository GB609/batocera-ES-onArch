## mergePropertyFiles

Simple merge of several property files. Merges them in the order given in `files[]`.  
Known options:
- `ignoreInvalid`: [true|false] - Whether files that don't exists should be ignored or not
- `preMergeAction`: [function] - Allows for transformation of a parsed file's content before merging.
Called once per file, with the arguments `(parsedDict, filename)`. Expected to return (transformed) object.

## sortDefinitions

sort entries of buttonDef[] to the iteration order of BTC_TO_SDL to make comparison easier

## toString

Generates an SDL string
