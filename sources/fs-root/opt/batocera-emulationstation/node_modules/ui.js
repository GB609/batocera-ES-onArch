/**
 * @file
 * @brief Wrapper and utility helper to spawn zenity dialogs.
 * @description
 * When required, this file will spawn an (interactive) bash subprocess and keep it open.  
 * Methods which open dialogs will build commands accordingly and pipe them through, resulting in something
 * similar to a dedicated UI (main) thread.
 * 
 * Output will also be fed back to method callers, if the dialog was not spawned in async mode.
